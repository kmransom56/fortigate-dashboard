# Topology

The topology view is the core of Scanopy, providing an interactive visualization of your network. This guide explains how to use and customize it.

## Navigating the Topology

*   **Pan**: Click and drag the background to move around the canvas.
*   **Zoom**: Use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out.
*   **View Host Details**: Click on any host to open its detail panel.

## Layout Modes

Scanopy offers several layout modes to organize your topology:

*   **Force-Directed** (Default): Simulates physical forces to position nodes, often revealing the natural structure of the network.
*   **Hierarchical**: Arranges nodes in a tree-like structure, useful for understanding dependencies.
*   **Circular**: Arranges nodes in a circle, useful for identifying central nodes.

You can switch between layout modes using the dropdown menu in the top-right corner.

## Filtering and Grouping

Use the controls in the left sidebar to customize the view:

### Group By

Group nodes by subnet, device type, or custom group to organize your topology.

### Filtering

Filter the topology to show or hide specific device types, subnets, or services.

1.  Configure your desired layout and filters.
2.  Click the **Save View** button in the top-right corner.
3.  Enter a name for your view and click **Save**.

You can switch between saved views using the dropdown menu.
