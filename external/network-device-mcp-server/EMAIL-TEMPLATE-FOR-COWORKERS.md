Hi Team,

I've created a super simple way for everyone to access our Network Device Management Dashboard. **No programming knowledge required!**

## 🎯 What This Gives You

- **Live Dashboard**: Monitor all BWW, ARBYS, and SONIC network devices in real-time
- **Device Health**: Instantly see which locations have network issues  
- **Brand Views**: Filter by restaurant brand to focus on your area
- **Auto-Updates**: Dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds with latest data

## 🚀 How to Get Started (5 Minutes Total)

### Step 1: Install Docker (One-Time Setup)
1. Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Download and install Docker Desktop
3. Start Docker Desktop (you'll see a whale 🐳 icon in your system tray)

### Step 2: Get the Network Dashboard
1. Download the project from: [GitHub Repository Link]
2. Extract to your Desktop
3. **Windows**: Double-click `ONE-CLICK-START.bat`
4. **Mac**: Open Terminal, run `./one-click-start.sh`

### Step 3: You're Done!
- Your browser will automatically open to the dashboard
- Bookmark: http://localhost:12000
- Use daily to monitor network health

## 📊 What You'll See

| Brand | Typical Device Count | What to Watch |

| **BWW** | ~678 devices | Store connectivity, POS systems |
| **ARBYS** | ~1,057 devices | Drive-thru networks, kitchen displays |  
| **SONIC** | ~3,454 devices | Car hop systems, digital menus |

## 🔧 Daily Usage

- **Green Numbers** = Everything is working great! ✅

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

- **"Can't access dashboard"**: Wait 3-4 minutes for startup, then try http://localhost:12000
- **"Port in use"**: Restart your computer and try again

**Still stuck?** Reply with a screenshot of any error messages.

## 🔒 Security & Data

- ✅ Everything runs on **your computer only** - no cloud access required

- ✅ No data leaves your machine
- ✅ Can run disconnected from internet (after initial setup)

*P.S. - The first startup takes 2-3 minutes while Docker downloads everything. After that, it starts in under 30 seconds.*
