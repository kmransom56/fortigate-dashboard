# How to Use the Screenshot Helper

This guide explains how to use the `screenshot-helper.html` file to generate consistent screenshots for the project documentation.

## Steps

1.  **Start the Application**: Before you begin, ensure the web application server is running. The helper relies on the app being accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Open the Helper Page**: Open the `screenshot-helper.html` file in your web browser.

3.  **Navigate and Capture**:
    *   The helper page contains a list of links corresponding to different views of the application.
    *   Click a link to open the correct view in a new tab.
    *   Follow the instructions next to each link, which specify what part of the interface to capture.

4.  **Save the Screenshot**:
    *   Use your system's screenshot tool (e.g., Windows + Shift + S on Windows, Cmd + Shift + 4 on macOS) to capture the designated area.
    *   Save the image in the `docs/images/` directory.
    *   Use the exact filename suggested on the helper page (e.g., `noc-dashboard-overview.png`).

By following these steps, you can ensure all project screenshots are uniform and correctly placed.
